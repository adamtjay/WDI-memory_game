			<h2>About</h2>

			<p>This game was created by Adam Julier because he kept on forgetting stuff. At one point his memory was so bad that he tried creating lists to help remember things, but then he would forget to even look at those lists. <br /><br />

			After developing and training with this Concentration game for 10 minutes a day, now he never forgets <em>anything</em>.</p>
